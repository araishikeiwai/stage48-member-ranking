How to run:
- put your voting files in `votes` folder
- run `ruby runner.rb`
- have your result in `vote_result.list`

Every voting file:
- has no leading blank lines
- has exactly 20 positive votes
- has blank line after 20 positive votes
- has 0 to 5 negative votes, put after the blank line
- has no trailing blank lines
- can be in .txt or no extension

Every line in voting file:
- has eligible member's name (refer to ithebigc's opening post)
- has to be sorted from your number 1 to number 25
- doesn't need that vote value, why bother typing it if computer can do it
- can have line number or not, whatever pleases you
